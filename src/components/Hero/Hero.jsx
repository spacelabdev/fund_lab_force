                        As diversity fuels creativity and innovation, we here at SpaceLab strongly value the voices and perspectives of those underrepresented in the community.

                        One of our goals is to create paid fellowships, internships, scholarship opportunities, and debt relief for those who are underrepresented, including but not limited to women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color. Helping members of the community who struggle economically will provide them with the liberty and flexibility necessary to explore new career paths in science and technology.
